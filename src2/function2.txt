Function Name: handle_company_asset_query

Purpose:
This function retrieves information about companies and their assets based on the level of detail provided in the user's query. It accepts three parameters:
- company_type: a required string that specifies whether the user is referring to "renter" or "delivery" companies. It maps to either get_renter_companies or get_delivery_companies.
- company_name: an optional string used to find a specific company by name within the selected company type.
- asset_name: an optional string used to search for a specific asset (equipment or vehicle) within the selected company.

The function operates in three modes:

1. If only company_type is provided:
   It fetches and returns a list of all companies of the given type, filtering out only key information such as name, city, role, etc.

2. If both company_type and company_name are provided:
   It locates the specified company and returns only the matched company details.

3. If all three parameters are provided:
   It retrieves the list of assets belonging to the matched company and searches for a specific asset by name.
   - If the asset is found, it returns the company info, filtered asset list, and asset details.
   - If not found, it returns the company info, filtered assets, and an appropriate error message.

This function is useful for hierarchical asset search where a user might ask:
- “Show me all equipment companies”
- “Find the company named ‘Pennco’ under renter companies”
- “Does Pennco have a Bobcat available?”

Function Name: call_user_function

Purpose:
This function acts as a dispatcher that dynamically calls one of several predefined utility functions based on the provided function name and argument. It serves as a central gateway to invoke specific functionality without calling each function directly.

It accepts two parameters:
- function_name (str): The name of the function to call. Supported values include:
  - "get_booking_list" → calls get_user_booking_list
  - "get_usr_favourite_list" → calls get_favourite_list
  - "company_cat_list" → calls renter_company_category
- arg (optional): The argument passed to the respective function. Its usage depends on the specific function being invoked.

How it works:
- If function_name matches one of the supported values, it invokes the corresponding function with the provided argument.
- If the function name is not recognized, it raises a ValueError indicating the unknown function.

IMPORTANT:
- Any user query about favorites (e.g., "my favorite company", "favorite vehicles", "favorite equipment"), categories (e.g., "show company categories"), or bookings (e.g., "my bookings", "cancelled bookings") MUST be routed to call_user_function, NOT handle_company_asset_query.
- Only queries about searching for or listing companies/assets (not favorites, categories, or bookings) should use handle_company_asset_query.

Sample Query-to-Function Mapping:

User Query: "List my favorite vehicles"
→ function_name: "get_usr_favourite_list", arg: "vehicle"
→ Resolved Function: get_favourite_list("vehicle")

User Query: "List my favorite companies"
→ function_name: "get_usr_favourite_list", arg: "company"
→ Resolved Function: get_favourite_list("company")

User Query: "Show my bookings"
→ function_name: "get_booking_list", arg: None
→ Resolved Function: get_user_booking_list(None)

User Query: "Show my cancelled bookings"
→ function_name: "get_booking_list", arg: "cancelled"
→ Resolved Function: get_user_booking_list("cancelled")

User Query: "Show renter company categories Excavators"
→ function_name: "company_cat_list", arg: Excavators
→ Resolved Function: renter_company_category(Excavators)
